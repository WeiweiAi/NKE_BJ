The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of Läuger and Apell, Eur.

As ions are transported, they become transiently trapped between intracellular and extracellular gates. Once the external gate opens, three Na+ ions are released, followed by the binding and occlusion of two K+ ions. While the mechanisms of Na+ release have been well characterized by the study of transient Na+ currents, smaller and faster transient currents mediated by external K+ have been more difficult to study. Here we show that external K+ ions travelling to their binding sites sense only a small fraction of the electric field as they rapidly and simultaneously become occluded. Consistent with these results, molecular dynamics simulations of a pump model show a wide water-filled access channel connecting the binding site to the external solution. These results suggest a mechanism of K+ gating different from that of Na+ occlusion.},

It may be thought of as having three substrates (ATP, intracellular Na+ ions, and extracellular K+ ions) and four products (ADP, orthophosphate, extracellular Na+ ions, and intracellular K+ ions.) Because more Na+ ions are pumped out than K+ ions are pumped in, the activity of the enzyme generates an outward movement of positive charge, and this outward current may also be considered a “product” of the reaction.},

In preparations of broken membranes it appears as an adenosine triphosphatase dependent on magnesium, sodium, and potassium ions together. In this adenosine triphosphatase a phosphorylated intermediate is formed from adenosine triphosphate in the presence of sodium ions and is hydrolyzed with the addition of potassium ions. The normal intermediate was not split by adenosine diphosphate. However, selective poisoning by N-ethylmaleimide or partial inhibition by a low magnesium ion concentration yielded an intermediate split by adenosine diphosphate and insensitive to potassium ions. Pulse experiments on the native enzyme supported further a hypothesis of a sequence of phosphorylated forms, the first being made reversibly from adenosine triphosphate in the presence of sodium ion and the second being made irreversiblyfrom the first and hydrolyzed in the presence of potassium ion. The cardioactive steriod inhibitor, ouabain, appeared to combine preferentially with the second form. Phosphorylation was at the same active site according to electrophoretic patterns of proteolytic phosphorylated fragments of both reactive forms. It is concluded that there is a conformational change in the active center for phosphorylation during the normal reaction sequence. This change may be linked to one required theoretically for active translocation of ions across the cell membrane.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract The cell membrane Na,K-ATPase is a member of the P-type family of active cation transport proteins. Recently the molecular structure of the related sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase in an E1 conformation has been determined at 2.6 Å resolution. Furthermore, theoretical models of the Ca-ATPase in E2 conformations are available. As a result of these developments, these structural data have allowed construction of homology models that address the central questions of mechanism of active cation transport by all P-type cation pumps. This review relates recent evidence on functional sites of Na,K-ATPase for the substrate (ATP), the essential cofactor (Mg2+ ions), and the transported cations (Na+ and K+) to the molecular structure. The essential elements of the Ca-ATPase structure, including 10 transmembrane helices and well-defined N, P, and A cytoplasmic domains, are common to all PII-type pumps such as Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPases. However, for Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, which consist of both α- and β-subunits, there may be some detailed differences in regions of subunit interactions. Mutagenesis, proteolytic cleavage, and transition metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavages are providing much evidence about residues involved in binding of Na+, K+, ATP, and Mg2+ ions and changes accompanying E1-E2 or E1-P-E2-P conformational transitions. We discuss this evidence in relation to N, P, and A cytoplasmic domain interactions, and long-range interactions between the active site and the Na+ and K+ sites in the transmembrane segments, for the different steps of the catalytic cycle.},

	abstract = {1. At high internal K concentrations the efflux of Na from red cells increases with internal Na concentration following an S-shaped curve. As internal K is reduced the S-shaped region and the value of internal Na for which the Na efflux is half-maximal are both shifted progressively towards zero., 2. The effects of internal Na on the shape of the Na efflux curves can be quantitatively accounted for if it is assumed that the rate of Na efflux is linearly related to the number of pump units having three identical and non-interacting sites occupied by Na., 3. The effects of internal K on the shape of the Na efflux curves are fully explained if it is assumed that the inner sites for Na of the Na pump also behave as identical and non-interacting sites for internal K, being the K-carrier complexes unable to promote Na translocation. The apparent affinity of the Na pump for internal K is about 50 times less than for internal Na., 4. Internal K not only alters the apparent affinity of the Na pump for Na, but also affects its turnover rate. The turnover rate of Na: K exchange increases with internal K following a curve which saturates at about 30 mM internal K. The turnover rate for Na:Na exchange increases linearly with internal K., 5. The linear dependence of the rate of Na:Na exchange on internal K explains why, when internal Na is increased at the expense of internal K, the rate of Na:Na exchange progressively decreases after passing through a maximum., 6. The effects of external Na on the rate of Na:Na exchange can be satisfactorily explained assuming that they are due to the occupation by external Na of three identical and non-interacting sites on each pump unit. The apparent affinity of the Na pump for external Na is about 160 times less than the apparent affinity for internal Na., 7. Under all the experimental conditions tested, it was found that the relation between flux and cation concentration at one of the surfaces of the cell membrane is altered only by a constant factor by changes in the cation composition at the opposite surface of the cell membrane. This fact strongly suggests that there are no interactions between the inner and outer sites of the Na pump., 8. The effects of inner and outer cations on both the Na:K and the Na:Na exchanges catalysed by the Na pump suggest that cation fluxes are proportional to the number of pump units having its inner and outer sites simultaneously occupied by the relevant cations. It seems therefore that sequential models for ion transort do not provide an adequate description of the molecular mechanism of active transport in red cells.},

Most charge moves during transitions that release Na+ to the cell exterior. When pumps are constrained to bind and release only Na+, a membrane voltage-step redistributes pumps among conformations with zero, one, two or three bound Na+, thereby transiently generating current. By applying rapid voltage steps to squid giant axons, we previously identified three components in such transient currents, with distinct relaxation speeds: fast (which nearly parallels the voltage-jump time course), medium speed (τm=0.2–0.5 ms) and slow (τs=1–10 ms). Here we show that these three components are tightly correlated, both in their magnitudes and in the time courses of their changes. The correlations reveal the dynamics of the conformational rearrangements that release three Na+ to the exterior (or sequester them into their binding sites) one at a time, in an obligatorily sequential manner.},

An analysis of thermal movements of protein atoms in the crystal shows that the M3–M4E helix pair opens and closes the ion pathway leading to the extracellular medium, allowing K+ at site II to be substituted first. Taken together, these results indicate that site I K+ is the first cation to bind to the empty cation-binding sites after releasing three Na+., 
The Na+,K+-ATPase moves three Na+ ions out of the cell and transfers two K+ ions in the opposite direction. Here the authors use X-ray crystallography to look at the substitution of two bound K+ with those in the medium and show that it occurs sequentially through a narrow gate.},

This is not predicted by the classical Albers-Post scheme of the Na+,K+-ATPase mechanism, where extracellular Na+ should act as a competitive inhibitor of extracellular K+ binding, which is necessary for the stimulation of enzyme dephosphorylation and the pumping of K+ ions into the cytoplasm. The increase in Ip is consistent with Na+ binding to an extracellular allosteric site, independent of the ion transport sites, and an increase in turnover via an acceleration of the rate-determining release of K+ to the cytoplasm, E2(K+)2 → E1 + 2K+. At normal physiological concentrations of extracellular Na+ of 140 mM, it is to be expected that binding of Na+ to the allosteric site would be nearly saturated. Its purpose would seem to be simply to optimize the enzyme’s ion pumping rate under its normal physiological conditions. Based on published crystal structures, a possible location of the allosteric site is within a cleft between the α- and β-subunits of the enzyme.},

	abstract = {Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na+/K+-ATPase, NKA) is an ion pump that generates an electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing ATP. During each Post-Albers cycle, NKA exchanges three cytoplasmic sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions through alternating changes between the E1 and E2 states. Hitherto, several steps remained unknown during the complete working cycle of NKA. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of recombinant human NKA (hNKA) in three distinct states at 2.7–3.2 Å resolution, representing the E1·3Na and E1·3Na·ATP states with cytosolic gates open and the basic E2·[2K] state, respectively. This work provides the insights into the cytoplasmic Na+ entrance pathway and the mechanism of cytoplasmic gate closure coupled with ATP hydrolysis, filling crucial gaps in the structural elucidation of the Post-Albers cycle of NKA.},

	abstract = {The observed standard free energy change (ΔG0obs) for the hydrolysis of the terminal pyrophosphate bond of ATP has been experimentally determined under physiological conditions using an entirely new set of reactions. The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) for the combined reactions of acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) and phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) has been determined at 38°, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and varying free [Mg2+]. The Kobs of these combined reactions reflects the difference between ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA and the ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of ATP. Using Σ and square brackets to indicate total concentration, Kobs = [ΣADP][ΣPi]/[ΣATP] x [Acetyl-CoA]/[ΣAcetate][CoA] The observed value of this combined equilibrium constant varies with free [Mg2+], being 0.984 ± 0.009 when [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.218 ± 0.002 when free [Mg2+] = 10-3m. The ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA is virtually unaffected by the free [Mg2+] and has been previously determined to be -8.54 Cal per mole (-35.75 kJ per mole) under the same conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Therefore at pH 7.0, at ionic strength 0.25, at 38°, and taking the standard state of liquid water to have activity = unity ([H2O] = 1) the ΔG0obs for the reaction [see PDF for equation] can be calculated to be -8.53 Cal per mole (-35.69 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 0 and -7.60 Cal per mole (-31.80 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 10-3m. The corresponding values of Kobs for the ATP hydrolysis reaction are 9.86 x 105m ([Mg2+] = 0) and 2.19 x 105m ([Mg2+] = 10-3m). Equations have been developed for calculating from the experimental data the ΔG0obs of ATP hydrolysis at different free magnesium and hydrogen ion concentrations. The Kobs of ATP hydrolysis has been used in combination with the Kobs of the citrate synthase reaction (EC 4.1.3.7) to calculate the Kobs of the ATP-citrate lyase reaction (EC 4.1.3.8) Kobs = [ΣADP][Acetyl-CoA] [ΣPi] [ΣOxaloacetate]/[ΣATP] [CoA] [ΣCitrate] Under the same near physiological conditions of 38°, pH 7.0, and ionic strength 0.25, the value of Kobs for the ATP-citrate lyase reaction was found to be very sensitive to the free [Mg2+], being 0.975 m at [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.0985 m when free [Mg2+] = 10-3m.},

By examining the pH-dependence of the hydrolysis Gibbs free energy, we show that in fact, above pH 7, ATP hydrolysis is spontaneous due mainly to the low concentration of the H+ that is released as product. Hence, ATP is essentially just an electrophilic target whose attack by H2O causes the acidity of the water nucleophile to increase dramatically; the spontaneity of the resulting acid ionization supplies much of the released Gibbs free energy. We also find that fermentation lowers pH not due to its organic acid products (e.g., lactic, acetic, formic, or succinic acids), but again, due to the H+ product of ATP hydrolysis.},

	abstract = {Ischemia-induced hyperkalemia (accumulation of extracellular K+) predisposes the heart to the development of lethal reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. This phenomenon exhibits a triphasic time course and is thought to be mediated by a combination of three mechanisms: 1) increased cellular K+ efflux, 2) decreased cellular K+ influx, and 3) shrinkage of the extracellular space. These ischemia-induced electrophysiological changes are driven by an impaired cellular metabolism. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms, as well as the origin of the triphasic profile, have proven to be difficult to determine experimentally. In this study, the changes in metabolite concentrations that arise during 15 min of zero-flow global ischemia were incorporated into a dynamic model of cellular electrophysiology, which was extended to include a metabolically sensitive description of the Na+-K+ pump and ATP-sensitive K+ channel, in addition to cell volume regulation. The coupling of altered K+ fluxes and cell volume regulation enables an integrative simulation of ischemic hyperkalemia. These simulations were able to quantitatively reproduce experimental measurements of the accumulation of extracellular K+ during 15 min of simulated ischemia, both with respect to the degree of K+ loss as well as the triphasic time course. Analysis of the model indicates that the inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump is the dominant factor underlying this hyperkalemic behavior, accounting for ∼85\% of the observed extracellular K+ accumulation. It was found that the balance between activation and inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump, affected by the changing metabolite and ion concentrations (in particular, [ADP]), give rise to the triphasic profile associated with ischemic hyperkalemia.},

Based on information gained on the kinetics of the enzyme's partial reactions we consider via computer simulation whether modifications to the function of the combined Na+,K+-ATPase/plasma membrane complex system could lead to an increased body temperature, either through the course of evolution or during an individual's lifespan. The enzyme's kinetics must be considered because it is the rate of heat generation which determines body temperature, not simply the amount of heat per enzymatic cycle. The results obtained indicate that a decrease in thermodynamic efficiency of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which could come about by Na+ substituting for K+ on the enzyme's extracellular face, could not account for increased thermogenesis. The only feasible mechanisms are an increase in the enzyme's expression level or an increase in its ion pumping activity. The major source of Na+,K+-ATPase-related thermogenesis (72\% of heat production) is found to derive from passive Na+ diffusion into the cell, which counterbalances outward Na+ pumping to maintain a constant Na+ concentration gradient across the membrane. A simultaneous increase in both Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the membrane's passive Na+ permeability could promote a higher body temperature.},

	abstract = {The Na+/K+-ATPase is an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein of all animal cells that couples the exchange of intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+ to the hydrolysis of ATP. The asymmetric distribution of Na+ and K+ is essential for cellular life and constitutes the physical basis of a series of fundamental biological phenomena. The pumping mechanism is explained by the Albers–Post model. It involves the presence of gates alternatively exposing Na+/K+-ATPase transport sites to the intracellular and extracellular sides and includes occluded states in which both gates are simultaneously closed. Unlike for K+, information is lacking about Na+-occluded intermediates, as occluded Na+ was only detected in states incapable of performing a catalytic cycle, including two Na+-containing crystallographic structures. The current knowledge is that intracellular Na+ must bind to the transport sites and become occluded upon phosphorylation by ATP to be transported to the extracellular medium. Here, taking advantage of epigallocatechin-3-gallate to instantaneously stabilize native Na+-occluded intermediates, we isolated species with tightly bound Na+ in an enzyme able to perform a catalytic cycle, consistent with a genuine occluded state. We found that Na+ becomes spontaneously occluded in the E1 dephosphorylated form of the Na+/K+-ATPase, exhibiting positive interactions between binding sites. In fact, the addition of ATP does not produce an increase in Na+ occlusion as it would have been expected; on the contrary, occluded Na+ transiently decreases, whereas ATP lasts. These results reveal new properties of E1 intermediates of the Albers–Post model for explaining the Na+ transport pathway.},

This research, carried out mostly on cardiac myocytes, shows that in addition to pumping ions, Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with neighboring membrane proteins and organized cytosolic cascades of signaling proteins to send messages to the intracellular organelles. The signaling pathways that are rapidly elicited by the interaction of ouabain with Na+/K+-ATPase, and are independent of changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations, include activation of Src kinase, transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by Src, activation of Ras and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria. In cardiac myocytes, the resulting downstream events include the induction of some early response proto-oncogenes, activation of the transcription factors, activator protein-1 and nuclear factor kappa-B, regulation of a number of cardiac growth-related genes, and stimulation of protein synthesis and myocyte hypertrophy. For these downstream events, the induced reactive oxygen species and rise in intracellular Ca2+ are essential second messengers. In cells other than cardiac myocytes, the proximal pathways linked to Na+/K+-ATPase through protein–protein interactions are similar to those reported in myocytes, but the downstream events and consequences may be significantly different. The likely extracellular physiological stimuli for the signal transducing function of Na+/K+-ATPase are the endogenous ouabain-like hormones, and changes in extracellular K+ concentration.},

	abstract = {The heart beats approximately 100,000 times per day in humans, imposing substantial energetic demands on cardiac muscle. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential energy source for normal function of cardiac muscle during each beat, as it powers ion transport, intracellular Ca2+ handling, and actin–myosin cross-bridge cycling. Despite this, the impact of excitation–contraction coupling on the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]i) in myocytes is poorly understood. Here, we conducted real-time measurements of [ATP]i in ventricular myocytes using a genetically encoded ATP fluorescent reporter. Our data reveal rapid beat-to-beat variations in [ATP]i. Notably, diastolic [ATP]i was {\textless}1 mM, which is eightfold to 10-fold lower than previously estimated. Accordingly, ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels were active at physiological [ATP]i. Cells exhibited two distinct types of ATP fluctuations during an action potential: net increases (Mode 1) or decreases (Mode 2) in [ATP]i. Mode 1 [ATP]i increases necessitated Ca2+ entry and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and were associated with increases in mitochondrial Ca2+. By contrast, decreases in mitochondrial Ca2+ accompanied Mode 2 [ATP]i decreases. Down-regulation of the protein mitofusin 2 reduced the magnitude of [ATP]i fluctuations, indicating that SR-mitochondrial coupling plays a crucial role in the dynamic control of ATP levels. Activation of β-adrenergic receptors decreased [ATP]i, underscoring the energetic impact of this signaling pathway. Finally, our work suggests that cross-bridge cycling is the largest consumer of ATP in a ventricular myocyte during an action potential. These findings provide insights into the energetic demands of EC coupling and highlight the dynamic nature of ATP concentrations in cardiac muscle.},

	abstract = {The Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) is an ubiquitous enzyme consisting of α, β and γ subunits, and is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Na+ and K+ gradients across the cell membrane by transporting 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ into the cell. Sodium pump regulation is tissue as well as isoform specific. Intracellular messengers differentially regulate the activity of the individual NKA isozymes. Regulation of specific NKA isozymes gives cells the ability to precisely coordinate NKA activity to their physiological requirements. It is the only known receptor for the cardiac glycosides used to treat congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Endogenous ligands structurally similar to cardiac glycosides may act as natural regulators of the sodium pump in heart and other tissues. Identification of naturally occurring regulators of  NKA could initiate the discovery of new hormone-like control systems involved in the etiology of selected disease processes, hence the importance of understanding the relation of the sodium pump and its ligands to disease. Diabetes has a marked effect on the metabolism of a variety of tissues and because the NKA is critical for the membrane potential and many transports, a change in its activity in diabetes would have profound consequence in these tissues. NKA is also involved in hypertension, salt balance, cardiovascular and renal disorders, sperm capacitation, cell volume regulation, apoptosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, neurological disorders, lung edema clearance and preeclampsia. NKA activity and expression in the collecting duct of kidney are modulated physiologically by hormones like aldosterone, vasopressin, and insulin. NKA enzyme activity and subunit levels are reduced in carcinoma, NKA-β levels were highly reduced in an invasive form of human renal clear cell carcinoma, androgen-dependent prostate cancer, in early stages of urothelial cancer, as well as in poorly differentiated, highly motile carcinoma cell lines obtained from various tissues suggesting a functional link between reduced NKA-β expression and cancer progression. It could be a target for the development of anticancer drugs as it serves as a signal transducer, it is a player in cell adhesion and its aberrant expression and activity are implicated in the development and progression of different cancers.},

	abstract = {Like several other ion transporters, the Na+-K+ pump of animal cells is electrogenic. The pump generates the pump current I p. Under physiological conditions, I p is an outward current. It can be measured by electrophysiological methods. These methods permit the study of characteristics of the Na+-K+ pump in its physiological environment, i.e., in the cell membrane. The cell membrane, across which a potential gradient exists, separates the cytosol and extracellular medium, which have distinctly different ionic compositions. The introduction of the patch-clamp techniques and the enzymatic isolation of cells have facilitated the investigation of I p in single cardiac myocytes. This review summarizes and discusses the results obtained from I p measurements in isolated cardiac cells. These results offer new exciting insights into the voltage and ionic dependence of the Na+-K+ pump activity, its effect on membrane potential, and its modulation by hormones, transmitters, and drugs. They are fundamental for our current understanding of Na+-K+ pumping in electrically excitable cells.},

	abstract = {Leg nerves from the shore crab (Carcinus maenas) contain an adenosine triphosphatase which is located in the submicroscopic particles. The influence of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium ions on this enzyme has been investigated. The presence of magnesium ions is an obligatory requirement for the activity of the enzyme. Sodium ions increase the activity when magnesium ions are present. Potassium ions increase the activity when the system contains both magnesium and sodium ions. Potassium ions in high concentration inhibit that part of the activity which is due to Na+, while the activity due to Mg++ is not affected. Calcium ions inhibit the enzyme under all conditions. When Mg++ or Mg++ + Na+ are present in the system, the optimum magnesium concentration is equal to the concentration of ATP. If potassium ions are added, the optimum magnesium concentration is doubled. If calcium ions are also added, the optimum magnesium concentration becomes still higher, and it increases with the calcium concentration. A majority of these observations may be explained by assuming (a) that the substrate most readily attacked by the enzyme is sodium-magnesium-ATP, (b) that potassium ions stimulate the enzyme directly, and (c) that an increase in the concentration of potassium ions leads to a displacement of sodium ions from the substrate and accordingly to an inhibition of the reaction. If the system contains the four cations in concentrations roughly equal to those in the crab-nerve axoplasm, an increase in the sodium concentration as well as a decrease in the potassium concentration will lead to an intensification of the enzyme activity. This observation, as well as some other characteristics of the system, suggest that the adenosine triphosphatase studied here may be involved in the active extrusion of sodium from the nerve fibre.},

A major charge movement occurs during sodium translocation and accompanies the deocclusion of sodium ions or their release to the cell exterior, or both. The nature of the charge movement was examined by measurement of the unidirectional sodium-22 efflux mediated by Nai-Nao exchange (Nai and Nao are internal and external sodium ions) in voltage-clamped, internally dialyzed squid giant axons in the absence of potassium; in this way the pump activity was restricted to the sodium-translocation pathway. Although electroneutral, the Nai-Nao exchange was nevertheless voltage-sensitive: increasingly negative potentials enhanced its rate along a saturating sigmoid curve. Such voltage dependence demonstrates that the release and rebinding of external sodium is the predominant charge-moving (hence, voltage-sensitive) step, suggesting that extracellular sodium ions must reach their binding sites deep in the pump molecule through a high-field access channel. This implies that part of the pump molecule is functionally analogous to an ion channel.},

It is a target of cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) such as ouabain and digoxin. As CTSs are almost unique strong inhibitors specific to NKA, a wide range of derivatives has been developed for potential therapeutic use. Several crystal structures have been published for NKA-CTS complexes, but they fail to explain the largely different inhibitory properties of the various CTSs. For instance, although CTSs are thought to inhibit ATPase activity by binding to NKA in the E2P state, we do not know if large conformational changes accompany binding, as no crystal structure is available for the E2P state free of CTS. Here, we describe crystal structures of the BeF3− complex of NKA representing the E2P ground state and then eight crystal structures of seven CTSs, including rostafuroxin and istaroxime, two new members under clinical trials, in complex with NKA in the E2P state. The conformations of NKA are virtually identical in all complexes with and without CTSs, showing that CTSs bind to a preformed cavity in NKA. By comparing the inhibitory potency of the CTSs measured under four different conditions, we elucidate how different structural features of the CTSs result in different inhibitory properties. The crystal structures also explain K+-antagonism and suggest a route to isoform specific CTSs.},

	abstract = {The steady state kinetics of sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) suggests an activating action of adenosine triphosphate in addition to its action as a phosphate donor. This action might be an acceleration of dissociation of K+ or its congeners from the enzyme. To test this possibility transient kinetics of the phosphoenzyme was investigated. In membranes from guinea pig kidney the enzyme was phosphorylated in the presence of magnesium ion and sodium ion with adenosine triphosphate which was radioactive in the terminal phosphate group. To this phosphoenzyme were added congeners of potassium ion, namely, rubidium ion or lithium ion at concentrations which produced an equal acceleration of dephosphorylation. At these same concentrations in the steady state, the level of dephosphoenzyme was higher in the presence of rubidium ion than in the presence of lithium ion. Rephosphorylation was relatively inhibited in the presence of rubidium ion. Rubidium ion appeared to combine with the phosphoenzyme, split off the phosphate group, and remain with the dephosphoenzyme in a relatively stable complex. This complex was isolated kinetically by addition of a high concentration of sodium ion with oligomycin. The isolated complex was less stable following an increase in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate. It was concluded that adenosine triphosphate was activating the enzyme in a fashion functionally distinct from its action as a phosphate donor, since adenosine triphosphate does not phosphorylate the enzyme in the presence of rubidium ion without sodium ion and since the concentration of adenosine triphosphate required for activation was much higher than that required for phosphorylation. The relatively stable complex of rubidium ion with the dephosphoenzyme was interpreted as evidence for a closed or occluded conformation of the active site for translocation of potassium ion across the membrane. Toxic agents altered this complex of the dephosphoenzyme; phlorizin increased and tetraphenyl boron decreased its stability. This kinetic mechanism provides an interpretation for a paradoxical feature in the p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity of this enzyme system.},

Reasonable possibilities included a single positive charge moving outwards during Na translocation; or a single negative charge moving inwards during K translocation; or either positive or negative charges moving during both translocation steps, but in unequal quantities. Any step that involves net charge movement through the membrane must have voltage-dependent transition rates. Here we report measurements of transient, voltage-dependent, displacement currents generated by the pump when its normal Na/K transport cycle has been interrupted by removal of external K and it is thus constrained to carry out Na/Na exchange8. The quantity and voltage sensitivity of the charge moved during these transient currents suggests that Na translocation includes a voltage-dependent transition involving movement of one positive charge across the membrane. This single step can thus fully account for the electrogenic nature of Na/K exchange. The result provides important new insight into the molecular mechanism of active cation transport.},

Maximal ouabain-sensitive ‘on’ and ‘off’ charges were calculated to be 9.6 ± 0.9 and 9.1 ± 0.4 fC pF−1 (n= 4), respectively, with an effective valency of 0.48 ± 0.07 (n= 7). 4 Kinetics of the transient currents were independent of Vm and Tlo+ at positive potentials, but became more rapid at increasingly negative Vm values in an ion concentration-dependent fashion. 5 These data demonstrate that electrogenic steps participate in K+ transport by the Na+,K+-ATPase and that the electrogenic step is extracellular ion binding. 6 The temperature-and Vm-dependent properties of transient charge movements were compared under K+–K+ and Na+–Na+ exchange conditions. The data suggest that extracellular K+ and Na+ binding occur at different sites in the enzyme or to different enzyme conformations. The sum of the effective valencies, 1.14 ± 0.12, demonstrates that the electrogenicity of extracellular ion binding can explain the Vm dependence of ion transport by the Na+,K+-ATPase.},

	abstract = {The bond graph approach to modelling biochemical networks is extended to allow hierarchical construction of complex models from simpler components. This is made possible by representing the simpler components as thermodynamically open systems exchanging mass and energy via ports. A key feature of this approach is that the resultant models are robustly thermodynamically compliant: the thermodynamic compliance is not dependent on precise numerical values of parameters. Moreover, the models are reusable owing to the well-defined interface provided by the energy ports. To extract bond graph model parameters from parameters found in the literature, general and compact formulae are developed to relate free-energy constants and equilibrium constants. The existence and uniqueness of solutions is considered in terms of fundamental properties of stoichiometric matrices. The approach is illustrated by building a hierarchical bond graph model of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle.},

	abstract = {A major goal of systems biology is to develop comprehensive, multi-scale mathematical models of physiological systems that integrate biological knowledge from the scale of molecules to the scale of tissues and organs. Models on this scale hold great potential in advancing our knowledge of biology and medicine, but they have yet to be achieved in complex biological systems. It is widely acknowledged that constructing large-scale models requires the reuse and integration of existing models; however, model integration is currently challenging because many existing models violate the conservation laws of physics, especially conservation of energy. It is therefore highly desirable to express models in a framework that respects the laws of physics and thermodynamics. Bond graphs are an energy-based modelling framework, initially developed for use in multi-physics engineering systems to help derive equations consistent with the laws of physics. More recently, bond graphs have been applied to the field of biology where they have helped in making models physically and thermodynamically consistent. While bond graphs provide several advantages for large-scale modelling such as thermodynamic consistency and hierarchical modelling, they have yet to be applied to large-scale dynamic models of biological systems.

This thesis aims to develop methods based on the bond graph framework to facilitate model reuse and integration. These methods are demonstrated by applying them to biomolecular systems within the cardiac cell. Firstly, bond graphs are applied to membrane transporters, demonstrating that bond graphs can be used to correct thermodynamic inconsistencies within existing models. Secondly, independently developed models of ion channels and transporters are coupled into a model of cardiac electrophysiology, showing that bond graphs can be used to systematically explain the issues of drift and non-unique steady states that affect many existing models. Finally, a generalised method for simplifying models of enzyme kinetics is developed and used to facilitate the development of simple, thermodynamically consistent models of enzymes that are easily incorporated into larger models.},

Our general approach is illustrated by recreating a well-known model of an excitable membrane. This model is used to investigate the energy consumed during a membrane action potential thus contributing to the current debate on the trade-off between the speed of an action potential event and energy consumption. The influx of N a + is often taken as a proxy for energy consumption; in contrast, this study presents an energy-based model of action potentials. As the energy-based approach avoids the assumptions underlying the proxy approach it can be directly used to compute energy consumption in both healthy and diseased neurons. These results are illustrated by comparing the energy consumption of healthy and degenerative retinal ganglion cells using both simulated and in vitro data.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic aspects of chemical reactions have a long history in the physical chemistry literature. In particular, biochemical cycles require a source of energy to function. However, although fundamental, the role of chemical potential and Gibb's free energy in the analysis of biochemical systems is often overlooked leading to models which are physically impossible. The bond graph approach was developed for modelling engineering systems, where energy generation, storage and transmission are fundamental. The method focuses on how power flows between components and how energy is stored, transmitted or dissipated within components. Based on the early ideas of network thermodynamics, we have applied this approach to biochemical systems to generate models which automatically obey the laws of thermodynamics. We illustrate the method with examples of biochemical cycles. We have found that thermodynamically compliant models of simple biochemical cycles can easily be developed using this approach. In particular, both stoichiometric information and simulation models can be developed directly from the bond graph. Furthermore, model reduction and approximation while retaining structural and thermodynamic properties is facilitated. Because the bond graph approach is also modular and scaleable, we believe that it provides a secure foundation for building thermodynamically compliant models of large biochemical networks.},

	abstract = {Physical chemistry lies at the heart of the behaviour of those macromolecules and molecular assemblies that have vital roles in all living organisms. Physical principles determine the stability of proteins and nucleic acids, the rate at which biochemical reactions proceed, the transport of molecules across biological molecules; they allow us to describe structure and reactivity in complex biological systems, and make sense of how these systems operate. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences provides a balanced presentation of the concepts of physical chemistry, and their extensive applications to biology and biochemistry. It is written to straddle the worlds of physical chemistry and the life sciences and to show students how the tools of physical chemistry can elucidate and illuminate biological questions. Opening with a suite of chapters on Biochemical Thermodynamics, with a focus on energy conversion in biological cells and the factors that stabilize proteins, nucleic acids, and cell membranes, the book goes on to explore the Kinetics of Life Processes, examining the rates of chemical reactions, how rates can help characterise the mechanism of a reaction, and how enzymes affect reaction rates. A third section, Biomolecular Structure, looks at how concepts of physical chemistry can be used to establish those 'rules' that govern the assembly of complex biological structures, while the final section, Biomolecular Spectroscopy, describes the major techniques in biochemistry that are being applied to help us to explore biochemical processes and systems ever further. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences places emphasis on clear explanations of difficult concepts, with an eye toward building insight into biochemical phenomena. An extensive range of learning features, including worked examples, illustrations, self-tests, and case studies, support student learning throughout, while special attention is given to providing extensive help to students with those mathematical concepts and techniques that are so central to a sound understanding of physical chemistry. Balancing clarity and rigor of exposition of basic concepts with extensive discussion of biological techniques and processes, Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences is the perfect resource for every life science student who seeks to master those essentials of physical chemistry that underpin life itself. Online Resource Centre For students: - Web links for each chapter, pointing students to interesting sources of related information and data, to facilitate self-directed learning - A list of key equations for each chapter, to help students revise and master the key mathematical concepts that underpin the subject - Living graphs, which present graphs from the text in interactive format, and enable students to strengthen their learning by manipulating key variables and exploring the consequeneces - Three-dimensional, interactive models of the biomolecules appearing in the end-of-book atlas of structures For registered adopters of the book: Figures in electronic format},

	abstract = {Maximising FAIRness of biosimulation models requires a comprehensive description of model entities such as reactions, variables, and components. The COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community encourages the use of RDF with composite annotations that semantically involve ontologies to ensure completeness and accuracy. These annotations facilitate scientists to find models or detailed information to inform further reuse, such as model composition, reproduction, and curation. SPARQL has been recommended as a key standard to access semantic annotation with RDF, which helps get entities precisely. However, SPARQL is not suitable for most repository users who explore biosimulation models freely without adequate knowledge regarding ontologies, RDF structure, and SPARQL syntax. We propose here a text-based information retrieval approach, CASBERT, that is easy to use and can present candidates of relevant entities from models across a repository’s contents. CASBERT adapts Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), where each composite annotation about an entity is converted into an entity embedding for subsequent storage in a list-like structure. For entity lookup, a query is transformed to a query embedding and compared to the entity embeddings, and then the entities are displayed in order based on their similarity. The simple list-like structure makes it possible to implement CASBERT as an efficient search engine product, with inexpensive addition, modification, and insertion of entity embedding. To demonstrate and test CASBERT, we created a dataset for testing from the Physiome Model Repository and a static export of the BioModels database consisting of query-entities pairs. Measured using Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank, we found that our approach can perform better than the traditional bag-of-words method.},

	abstract = {Simulating complex biological and physiological systems and predicting their behaviours under different conditions remains challenging. Breaking systems into smaller and more manageable modules can address this challenge, assisting both model development and simulation. Nevertheless, existing computational models in biology and physiology are often not modular and therefore difficult to assemble into larger models. Even when this is possible, the resulting model may not be useful due to inconsistencies either with the laws of physics or the physiological behaviour of the system. Here, we propose a general methodology for composing models, combining the energy-based bond graph approach with semantics-based annotations. This approach improves model composition and ensures that a composite model is physically plausible. As an example, we demonstrate this approach to automated model composition using a model of human arterial circulation. The major benefit is that modellers can spend more time on understanding the behaviour of complex biological and physiological systems and less time wrangling with model composition.},

	abstract = {The epithelial transport system consists of structural subsystems of three transport barriers (membranes) and three solution compartments. Macroscopically, coupled dissipations in the system occur in barrier subsystems, and coupled free-energy increasing or decreasing processes in the system occur in compartment subsystems. Therefore, the barrier subsystem is assumed to be the dissipating subsystem, and the compartment subsystem is assumed to be the free-energy changing subsystem. These structural subsystems consist also of a set of elemental thermodynamic processes, that is, dissipations, processes of free-energy change and power conversions. Each elemental process can be represented by thermodynamic elements prepared in bond graphs. p]In the experiments described in this paper, thermodynamic elements expressing free-energy changes and couplings in compartment subsystems were gathered and modeled as a capacitive module. The capacitive module behaved as a solution compartment and a simultaneous equation could be derived in which a set of flows determined a set of absolute-potential changes in the solution compartment. Elements were gathered and were modeled as a resistive module. The resistive module behaved as a membrane and a simultaneous transport equation could be derived in which a set of forces determined a set of flows through the membrane. A model of the epithelial transport system was achieved by the block diagram with the above modules. As variables in the module, the force vector and the flow vector expressing sets of power variables were assigned, but not a force nor a flow. This model showed the topology of the system and behaved as the real system. This model and the derived equations were used to simulate the frog skin behavior as an example of an epithelial transport system.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a model of the membrane transport system in which the process of membrane transport is carried out in two steps. In the first step, using the bond-graph method of network thermodynamics, resistive and capacitive modules express subsystems as integrated circuits. The resistive module represents the irreversible dissipative process in the system. In the bond-graph representation of the resistive membrane module, the coupled dissipative process of a two-power system is simplified into a bond graph of the elemental circuit consisting of a transducer and two resistors. The Kedem and Katchalsky equation is interpreted by this elemental circuit. It is shown that a combination of elemental circuits becomes a resistive membrane module which includes several transport processes and an active transport mechanism. A paired capacitive module is also described which represents the reversible free-energy change process in both solution compartments across the membrane. In the bond-graph representation of the paired capacitive solutions module, a new two-port chemical element is introduced which provides for the relation of the solute flow, the volume flow and the concentration change. As the concentration of a solute is a two-valued function of solute and volume, the two-port capacitor represents the changes of both the chemical potential and osmotic pressure of a solute due to solute and volume changes in the solution compartment. Using the differences in the chemical potentials and osmotic pressures across the membrane as force variables, a model of a paired capacitive solution module representing the process of the total free-energy change in the single membrane transport system is made from one- and two-port capacitors and transducers. p]In the second step, the membrane transport system is designed from a combination of the resistive module and the paired capacitive module as subsystems. Using the model which encorepasses the design of both modules, simulation of the cell membrane behavior was attempted and the results are outlined in this paper. It is predicted that the electroosmosis and the volume changes within the compartments are critical factors in the mechanism of cell membrane transport.},

Here, we present a framework that can automatically convert SBML models into bond graphs, which imposes energy conservation laws on these models.

However, mathematical models of biochemistry frequently neglect the conservation of energy, leading to unrealistic behaviour. Energy-based models that are consistent with conservation of mass, charge and energy have the potential to aid the understanding of complex interactions between biological components, and are becoming easier to develop with recent advances in experimental measurements and databases. In this paper, we motivate the use of bond graphs (a modelling tool from engineering) for energy-based modelling and introduce, BondGraphTools, a Python library for constructing and analysing bond graph models. We use examples from biochemistry to illustrate how BondGraphTools can be used to automate model construction in systems biology while maintaining consistency with the laws of physics.},

As bond graphs have been widely used to model, analyse and synthesise engineering systems, this study suggests that they can play the same rôle in the modelling, analysis and synthesis of biomolecular systems. The particular structure of bond graphs arising from biomolecular systems is established and used to elucidate the relation between thermodynamically closed and open systems. Block diagram representations of the dynamics implied by these bond graphs are used to reveal implicit feedback structures and are linearised to allow the application of control-theoretical methods. Two concepts of modularity are examined: computational modularity where physical correctness is retained and behavioural modularity where module behaviour (such as ultrasensitivity) is retained. As well as providing computational modularity, bond graphs provide a natural formulation of behavioural modularity and reveal the sources of retroactivity. A bond graph approach to reducing retroactivity, and thus inter-module interaction, is shown to require a power supply such as that provided by the ATP ⇌ ADP + Pi reaction. The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (Raf–MEK–ERK pathway) is used as an illustrative example.},

The present study evaluated transients during long-term simulated activity in a mathematical model of the canine atrial AP. Stimulus current assignment to a specific ionic species contributed to stability. Ionic concentrations were least disturbed with the K+ stimulus current. All parameters stabilized within 6–7 h. Inward rectifier, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, L-type Ca2+, and Na+-Cl− cotransporter currents made the greatest contributions to stabilization of intracellular [K+], [Na+], [Ca2+], and [Cl−], respectively. Time-dependent AP shortening was largely due to the outward shift of Na+/Ca2+exchange related to intracellular Na+(Na

AP transients also occurred in canine atrial preparations, with the APD decreasing by ∼10 ms over 35 min, compared with ∼27 ms in the model. We conclude that model APD and ionic transients stabilize with the appropriate stimulus current assignment and that the mathematical limitation of equation singularity does not preclude meaningful long-term simulations. The model agrees qualitatively with experimental observations, but quantitative discrepancies highlight limitations of long-term model simulations.},

To address these issues, we reexamined ventricular models of myocyte AP developed in our laboratory with the following results. 1), Recognizing that the model involves a system of differential-algebraic equations, a procedure is developed for estimating consistent initial conditions that insure uniqueness and stability of the solution. 2), Model parameters that can be used to modify these initial conditions according to experimental values are identified. 3), A convergence criterion for steady-state solution is defined based on tracking the incremental contribution of each ion species to the membrane voltage. 4), Singularities in state variable formulations are removed analytically. 5), A biphasic current stimulus is implemented to completely eliminate stimulus artifact during long-term pacing over a broad range of frequencies. 6), Using the AP computed based on 1–5 above, an efficient scheme is developed for computing propagation in multicellular models.},

To address this issue, models have been proposed that invoke the charge conservation principle to calculate Vm from ion concentrations (“algebraic” method), rather than from transmembrane current (“differential” method). The aims of this study are to compare model behavior during prolonged periods of pacing using the algebraic and differential methods, and to address the issue of model drift. We pace the Luo–Rudy dynamic model of a cardiac ventricular cell and compare the time-dependent behavior of computed parameters using the algebraic and differential methods. When ions carried by the stimulus current are taken into account, the algebraic and differential methods yield identical results and neither shows drift in computed parameters. The present study establishes the proper pacing protocol for simulation studies of cellular behavior during long periods of rapid pacing. Such studies are essential for mechanistic understanding of arrhythmogenesis, since cells are subjected to rapid periodic stimulation during many arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {The membrane potential (Em) is a fundamental cellular parameter that is primarily determined by the transmembrane permeabilities and concentration gradients of various ions. However, ion gradients are themselves profoundly influenced by Em due to its influence upon transmembrane ion fluxes and cell volume (Vc). These interrelationships between Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations make computational modelling useful or necessary in order to guide experimentation and to achieve an integrated understanding of experimental data, particularly in complex, dynamic, multi-compartment systems such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes. A variety of quantitative techniques exist that may assist such understanding, from classical approaches such as the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation and the Gibbs–Donnan equilibrium, to more recent “current-summing” models as exemplified by cardiac myocyte models including those of DiFrancesco \& Noble, Luo \& Rudy and Puglisi \& Bers, or the “charge-difference” modelling technique of Fraser \& Huang so far applied to skeletal muscle. In general, the classical approaches provide useful and important insights into the relationships between Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations at steady state, providing their core assumptions are fully understood, while the more recent techniques permit the modelling of changing values of Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations. The present work therefore reviews the various approaches that may be used to calculate Em, Vc and intracellular ion concentrations with the aim of establishing the requirements for an integrated model that can both simulate dynamic systems and recapitulate the key findings of classical techniques regarding the cellular steady state. At a time when the number of cellular models is increasing at an unprecedented rate, it is hoped that this article will provide a useful and critical analysis of the mathematical techniques fundamental to each of them.},

Previous studies have linked these to violation of conservation laws, but only explored those issues with respect to charge conservation in specific models. Here, we propose a general and systematic method of identifying conservation laws hidden in models of cardiac electrophysiology by using bond graphs, and develop a bond graph model of the cardiac action potential to study long-term behaviour. Bond graphs provide an explicit energy-based framework for modelling physical systems, which makes them well suited for examining conservation within electrophysiological models. We find that the charge conservation laws derived in previous studies are examples of the more general concept of a ‘conserved moiety’. Conserved moieties explain model drift and non-unique steady states, generalizing the results from previous studies. The bond graph approach provides a rigorous method to check for drift and non-unique steady states in a wide range of cardiac action potential models, and can be extended to examine behaviours of other excitable systems.},

	abstract = {.The relationship of the theory of port-Hamiltonian systems with the mathematical concept of monotonicity is explored. The earlier introduced notion of incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems is extended to systems defined with respect to maximal cyclically monotone relations, together with their generating convex functions. This gives rise to interesting subclasses of incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems, with examples stemming from physical systems modeling as well as from convex optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how cyclical monotonicity for Dirac structures is equivalent to separability. An in-depth treatment is given of the composition of maximal monotone and maximal cyclically monotone relations, where in the latter case the resulting maximal cyclically monotone relation is shown to be computable through the use of generating functions. The results on compositionality are employed for steady-state analysis and for a convex optimization approach to the computation of the equilibria of interconnected incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, the relation to incremental and differential passivity is discussed, and it is shown how incrementally port-Hamiltonian systems with strictly convex Hamiltonians are equilibrium independent passive.},

Motivated by the need for computer-based design, we offer a spatially consistent discretization of the PDE system and, in a systematic manner, recover a compartmental ODE model on a simplicial triangulation of the spatial domain. Exploring the properties of a balanced weighted Laplacian matrix of the reaction network and the Laplacian of the simplicial complex, we characterize the space of equilibrium points and provide a simple stability analysis on the state space modulo the space of equilibrium points.

Each electrical flow is given by the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, and thus may be approximately computed in nearly-linear time. Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum s-t flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1-ε)-approximately maximum s-t flow in time {\textasciitilde}O(mn1/3ε-11/3). A dual version of our approach gives the fastest known algorithm for computing a (1+ε)-approximately minimum s-t cut. It takes {\textasciitilde}O(m+n4/3ε-16/3) time. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J. ACM 1998), which can be used to compute approximately maximum s-t flows in time {\textasciitilde}O(\{\vphantom{\}}m√nε-1), and approximately minimum s-t cuts in time {\textasciitilde}O(m+n3/2ε-3).},

However, subsystems may have high-dimensional dynamics and a large number of complex interconnections, and it is therefore relevant to study reduction methods for network systems. Here, we provide an overview of reduction methods for both the topological (interconnection) structure of a network and the dynamics of the nodes while preserving structural properties of the network. We first review topological complexity reduction methods based on graph clustering and aggregation, producing a reduced-order network model. Next, we consider reduction of the nodal dynamics using extensions of classical methods while preserving the stability and synchronization properties. Finally, we present a structure-preserving generalized balancing method for simultaneously simplifying the topological structure and the order of the nodal dynamics.},

In the case of gravitational potential energy, we treat the nodes of a graph as “particles” with masses and consider the potential energy of gravitational interactions between them. We prove that the maximum clique in a graph represents the minimum gravitational potential energy structure. This result yields a natural physics-based interpretation of the well-known Motzkin-Strauss formulation for the maximum clique problem. In the case of elastic potential energy, we assume that graph nodes are located on an elastic surface, the graph edges represent “springs” connecting the nodes on the surface, and consider the potential energy corresponding to elastic deformations of springs. We show that under certain reasonable assumptions on surface deformation, the second-smallest and the largest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix correspond to the minimum and the maximum elastic potential energies of a graph, respectively. Moreover, the associated eigenvectors correspond to the node heights in the minimum and maximum energy configurations. Note that the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is widely known as algebraic connectivity, and it turns out that this concept also has a simple and intuitive physics-based interpretation.},

The first sections deal with the linear case, covering examples such as mass-damper and hydraulic systems, which have a structure that is similar to symmetric consensus dynamics. The last section is concerned with a specific class of nonlinear physical network systems; namely detailed-balanced chemical reaction networks governed by mass action kinetics. In both cases, linear and nonlinear, the structure of the dynamics is similar, and is based on a weighted Laplacian matrix, together with an energy function capturing the energy storage at the nodes. We discuss two methods for structure-preserving model reduction. The first one is clustering; aggregating the nodes of the underlying graph to obtain a reduced graph. The second approach is based on neglecting the energy storage at some of the nodes, and subsequently eliminating those nodes (called Kron reduction).},

The central notion is the behavior, which consists of the set of time trajectories that are declared possible by the model of a dynamical system. Often, the behavior is defined as the set of solutions of a system of differential equations. Models that specify a behavior usually involve latent variables in addition to the manifest variables the model aims at. We have also described a methodology for modeling interconnected systems, called tearing, zooming, and linking. The underlying mathematical language consists of terminals, modules, the interconnection graph, the module embedding, and the manifest variable assignment. The combination of module equations, interconnection constraints, and manifest variable assignment leads to a latent-variable representation for the behavior of the manifest variables the model aims. This methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking offers a systematic procedure for modeling interconnected systems that is much better adapted to the physics of interconnected systems than input/output-modeling procedures such as, for example, Simulink. The methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking has many things in common with bond graphs.},

In this paper we use concepts from systems theory to develop two complementary tools that can help us understand the complex behaviour of such system models: one based on model decomposition and one on model reduction. Our aim is to algorithmically produce biologically meaningful, simplified models, which can then be used for further analysis and design.

So far, the Michaelis-Menten equation has provided a fundamental framework of enzymatic activity. However, there is still no concrete guideline on how the parameters should be optimized towards higher activity. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the Michaelis-Menten constant (\$\$\{K\}\_\{m\}\$\$) to the substrate concentration (\$\$[\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{S\}\}\}\}\}\}]\$\$) enhances enzymatic activity. This guideline (\$\$\{K\}\_\{m\}=[\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{S\}\}\}\}\}\}]\$\$) was obtained mathematically by assuming that thermodynamically favorable reactions have higher rate constants, and that the total driving force is fixed. Due to the generality of these thermodynamic considerations, we propose \$\$\{K\}\_\{m\}=[\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{S\}\}\}\}\}\}]\$\$as a general concept to enhance enzymatic activity. Our bioinformatic analysis reveals that the \$\$\{K\}\_\{m\}\$\$and in vivo substrate concentrations are consistent across a dataset of approximately 1000 enzymes, suggesting that even natural selection follows the principle \$\$\{K\}\_\{m\}=[\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{S\}\}\}\}\}\}]\$\$.},

	abstract = {In recent years, algorithms have been developed to help automate the production of dynamic system models. Part of this effort has been the development of algorithms that use modeling metrics for generating minimum complexity models with realization preserving structure and parameters. Existing algorithms, add or remove ideal compliant elements from a model, and consequently do not equally emphasize the contribution of the other fundamental physical phenomena, i.e., ideal inertial or resistive elements, to the overall system behavior. Furthermore, these algorithms have only been developed for linear or linearized models, leaving the automated production of models of nonlinear systems unresolved. Other model reduction techniques suffer from similar limitations due to linearity or the requirement that the reduced models be realization preserving. This paper presents a new modeling metric, activity, which is based on energy. This metric is used to order the importance of all energy elements in a system model. The ranking of the energy elements provides the relative importance of the model parameters and this information is used as a basis to reduce the size of the model and as a type of parameter sensitivity information for system design. The metric is implemented in an automated modeling algorithm called model order reduction algorithm (MORA) that can automatically generate a hierarchical series of reduced models that are realization preserving based on choosing the energy threshold below which energy elements are not included in the model. Finally, MORA is applied to a nonlinear quarter car model to illustrate that energy elements with low activity can be eliminated from the model resulting in a reduced order model, with physically meaningful parameters, which also accurately predicts the behavior of the full model. The activity metric appears to be a valuable metric for automating the reduction of nonlinear system models—providing in the process models that provide better insight and may be more numerically efficient.},

This metric (1) accounts for correlations between energy flow patterns in a model using the Karhunen–Loève expansion; (2) examines all energetic connections in a model, thereby assessing the relative importance of both energetic components and their interactions, and enabling both order and structural reduction; and (3) is realization preserving, in the sense of not requiring a state transformation. A reduction scheme based on this metric is presented and illustrated using a simple example. The example shows that the proposed method can successfully concurrently reduce model order and structure without requiring a realization change, and that it can provide an improved assessment of the importance of various model components due to its correlation-based nature.},

The method can validate simplifying assumptions based on decoupling, determine when decoupling breaks down due to changes in system parameters or inputs, and indicate required model changes. A high-fidelity model is first generated using the bond graph formalism. The relative contributions of the terms of the generalized Kirchoff loop and node equations are computed by calculating and comparing a measure of their power flow. Negligible aggregate bond power at a constraint equation node indicates an unnecessary term, which is then removed from the model by replacing the associated bond by a modulated source of generalized effort or flow. If replacement of all low-power bonds creates separate bond graphs that are joined by modulating signals, then the model can be partitioned into driving and driven subsystems. The partitions are smaller than the original model, have lower-dimension design variable vectors, and can be simulated separately or in parallel. The partitioning algorithm can be employed alongside existing automated modeling techniques to facilitate efficient, accurate simulation-based design of dynamic systems.},

While MORA was originally developed for the reduction of nonlinear models, the purpose of this paper is to gain insight into this methodology when applied to the reduction of linear models. Toward this end, the steady-state response to sinusoidal inputs is considered. Element activity is calculated analytically for any given excitation frequency, and a series of reduced models, which depend on the excitation frequency content, are generated. The results show through a quarter-car vehicle model that MORA generates a series of models whose spectral radius increases, as successively lower activity elements are included. It is demonstrated that low activity elements are related with high-frequency dynamics.},

	abstract = {The modular modeling paradigm facilitates the efficient building, verification and handling of complex system models by assembling them from general-purpose component models. A drawback of this paradigm, however, is that the assembled system models may have excessively complex structures for certain purposes due to the amount of detail in the component models that has been introduced to promote modularity. For example, a multibody system can be modeled using generic rigid-body models with 6 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) to represent the components of the system, but then constraints have to be added to the model to match the DoF of the system. This work presents a structural simplification technique that can detect such unnecessary complexities in a modular bond-graph system model and eliminate them without compromising accuracy. To this end, the activity concept in the literature is extended to define “inactivity” for junction elements, and simplification is obtained by detecting and eliminating inactive junction elements and by propagating the implications. It is shown by example that this simple idea can result in models that are conceptually and computationally more efficient than the original modular models. The realization-preserving and input-dependent characteristics of this approach are highlighted.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews and extends a technique to detect weak coupling (one-way coupling or complete decoupling) among elements of a dynamic system model, and to partition and reduce models in which weak coupling is found. The ability to partition a model increases the potential for physical-domain model reduction, and allows parallel simulation of smaller individual submodels that can reduce computation time. Negligible constraint equation terms are identified and eliminated in a bond graph by converting inactive power bonds to modulated sources. If separate bond graphs result, between which all modulating signals move from a “driving” subgraph to a “driven” one, then one-way coupling exists in the model and it can be separated into driving and driven partitions. Information flow between the subgraphs is one-way. In this paper the algorithm is extended to models in which two-way information flow from modulating signals precludes complete partitioning. It is shown for several classes of modulating signals that, under certain conditions the signal is “weak” and therefore can be eliminated. Removal of weak signals allows partitioning of the longitudinal and pitch dynamics of a medium-duty truck model. The intensity of dynamic coupling and the potential for model reduction are shown to depend on the magnitude of system parameters and the severity of inputs such as road roughness.},

	abstract = {We propose a data-driven approach aiming at reducing Bond Graphs by using simulation data. The output of the approach is a hybrid model that contains a Reduced Bond Graph coupled to a simple artificial neural network. In this paper, the neural network is obtained by a linear calibration procedure. We propose a method that contains two training steps. First, the method selects the components of the original Bond Graph that are kept in the reduced Bond Graph. Secondly, the method builds an artificial neural network that supplements the reduced Bond Graph. Because the output of the proposed approach is a hybrid model, not solely data, it becomes difficult to use a usual Backpropagation Through Time to calibrate the weights of the neural network. So, in a first attempt, a very simple neural network is proposed by following a model reduction approach. As an industrial application, we consider the modeling of the automotive cabins thermal behavior. The data used for the training step are obtained via solutions of differential algebraic equations by means of a design of experiment. Simple cooling simulations are run during the training step. We show a simulation speed-up when the reduced bond graph is used to simulate the driving cycle of the WLTP vehicles homologation procedure, while preserving accuracy on output variables. The variables of the original bond graph are split into a set of primary variables, a set of secondary variables and a set of tertiary variables. The reduced bond graph contains all the primary variables, but none of the tertiary variables. While secondary variables are coupled to primary ones via an artificial neural network. Besides, the mathematical modeling used to describe the proposed method allows generalizing it to any set of differential algebraic equations, and not only to bond graphs. Finally, we discuss the extension of the coupling approach to more complex artificial neural networks.},

	abstract = {The technology for building functionally complete or ‘whole-cell’ biological simulations is rapidly developing. However, the predictive capabilities of these simulations are hindered by the availability of parameter values, which are often difficult or even impossible to obtain experimentally and must therefore be estimated. Using E. coli’s glycolytic network as a model system, we describe and apply a new method which can estimate the values of all the system’s 102 parameters – fit to observations from studies of proteomics, metabolomics, enzyme kinetics and chemical energetics – and find that the resulting metabolic models are not only well-fit, but also dynamically stable. An analysis of how well parameter values in the network were determined by the training data revealed that over 80\% of the parameter values were not well-specified. Moreover, the distribution of well-determined values was biased to a specific part of the network and against certain types of experimental data. Our results also suggest that perturbing the functional, energetic space of parameters (rather than traditional metabolic parameters) is a superior strategy for exploring the space of biological dynamics. The estimated parameter values matched both training data and previously withheld validation data within an order of magnitude for over 85\% of the data points; notably, the area of greatest frustration in the network was also the most fully determined. Finally, our estimation method showed that fidelity to physiological observations such as network response time is enforced at the cost of fit to molecular parameter values. In summary, our reformulation enables estimation of accurate, biologically relevant parameters, generates insight into the biology of the simulated network, and appears generalizable to any biochemical network – potentially including whole-cell models.},

However, in general, kinetic models of biochemical systems do not remain thermodynamically consistent after perturbing parameters. To address this issue, we analyse the sensitivity of biological reaction networks in the context of a bond graph representation. We find that the parameter sensitivities can themselves be represented as bond graph components, mirroring potential mechanisms for controlling biochemistry. In particular, a sensitivity system is derived which re-expresses parameter variation as additional system inputs. The sensitivity system is then linearized with respect to these new inputs to derive a linear system which can be used to give local sensitivity to parameters in terms of linear system properties such as gain and time constant. This linear system can also be used to find so-called sloppy parameters in biological models. We verify our approach using a model of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, confirming the reactions and metabolites most essential to maintaining the function of the pathway.},

	abstract = {Energy is one of the fundamental concepts in science and engineering practice, where it is common to view dynamical systems as energy-transformation devices. This perspective is particularly useful in studying complex nonlinear systems by decomposing them into simpler subsystems that, upon interconnection, add up their energies to determine the full system's behavior. The action of a controller may also be understood in energy terms as another dynamical system. The control problem can then be recast as finding a dynamical system and an interconnection pattern such that the overall energy function takes the desired form. This energy-shaping approach is the essence of passivity-based control (PBC), a controller design technique that is very well known in mechanical systems. Our objectives in the article are threefold. First, to call attention to the fact that PBC does not rely on some particular structural properties of mechanical systems, but hinges on the more fundamental (and universal) property of energy balancing. Second, to identify the physical obstacles that hamper the use of standard PBC in applications other than mechanical systems. In particular, we show that standard PBC is stymied by the presence of unbounded energy dissipation, hence it is applicable only to systems that are stabilizable with passive controllers. Third, to revisit a PBC theory that has been developed to overcome the dissipation obstacle as well as to make the incorporation of process prior knowledge more systematic. These two important features allow us to design energy-based controllers for a wide range of physical systems.},

This energy-based approach is developed using the engineering-inspired bond graph methodology to represent biomolecular reaction networks. The approach is introduced using glycolysis as an exemplar; and is then applied to analyse the efficiency of free energy transduction in a biomolecular cycle model of a transporter protein [sodium-glucose transport protein 1 (SGLT1)].

The bond-graph modeling language offers these properties. When systems structures conform to the bond-graph notation, all interfaces are defined as physical “power ports” which are guaranteed to exchange power. Having a single type of interface is a key feature when aiming for modular, composable systems. Furthermore, the facility to monitor energy flows in the system through power ports allows the definition of system-wide properties based on component properties. In this paper we present a metamodel of the bond-graph language aimed to facilitate the description and deployment of software components for cyber-physical systems. This effort provides a formalized description of standardized interfaces that enable physics-conformal interconnections. We present a use-case showing that the metamodel enables composability, reusability, extensibility, replaceability and independence of control software components.},

	abstract = {Recent results on the passivity analysis and control of physical systems, based on the balance of dissipated and internally generated energy, are generalised to nonlinear systems represented by bond graphs. For linear systems, the internally generated energy associated with modulated sources can be coupled with the dissipative field, so that if external energy sources are excluded, then the system is passive (or dissipative) if the resulting composite multiport field is passive. Such a result for linear systems was previously conveniently expressed in terms of a characteristic matrix being positive semi-definite. Parasitic elements of previous works are no longer required, which allows working on the original bond graph of lower dimension than the augmented bond graph and for no-linear systems avoid inverting the dissipative nonlinear constitutive relations. For nonlinear systems, passivity is now considered through the explicit difference between the dissipated and the internally generated energy. If this energy difference is positive, the system is passive. For control systems, the current work proposes that the controller is designed to have a structure similar to the plant (linear or nonlinear), and its parameters are chosen to assure that in closed-loop the difference between the dissipated and the internally generated energy is positive. In particular, the control parameters can be chosen to assign a desired dissipated energy or to cancel by feedback the internally generated energy and to add damping, therefore achieving sufficient conditions for the passivity of the closed-loop system.},

	abstract = {Integrated dynamic systems such as mechatronic or control systems generally contain passive elements and internal energy sources that are appropriately modulated to perform the desired dynamic actions. The overall passivity of such systems is a useful property that relates to the stability and the safety of the system, in the sense that the maximum net amount of energy that the system can impart to the environment is limited by its initial state. In this paper, conditions under which a physical system containing internal modulated sources is globally passive are investigated using bond graph modelling techniques. For the class of systems under consideration, bond graph models include power bonds and active (signals) bonds modulating embedded energy sources, so that the continuity of power (or energy conservation) in the junction structure is not satisfied. For the purpose of the analysis, a so-called bond graph pseudo-junction structure is proposed as an alternative representation for linear time-invariant (LTI) bond graph models with internal modulated sources. The pseudo-junction structure highlights the existence of a multiport coupled resistive field involving the modulation gains of the internal sources and the parameters of dissipative elements, therefore implicitly realizing the balance of internal energy generation and dissipation. Moreover, it can be regarded as consisting of an inner structure which satisfies the continuity of power, and an outer structure in which a power scaling is performed in relation with the dissipative field. The associated multiport coupled resistive field constitutive equations can then be used to determine the passivity property of the overall system. The paper focuses on systems interconnected in cascade (with no loading effect) or in closed-loop configurations which are common in control systems.},

	abstract = {Engineering systems modeling and analysis based on the bond graph approach has been applied to biomolecular systems. In this context, the notion of a Faraday-equivalent chemical potential is introduced which allows chemical potential to be expressed in an analogous manner to electrical volts thus allowing engineering intuition to be applied to biomolecular systems. Redox reactions, and their representation by half-reactions, are key components of biological systems which involve both electrical and chemical domains. A bond graph interpretation of redox reactions is given which combines bond graphs with the Faraday-equivalent chemical potential. This approach is particularly relevant when the biomolecular system implements chemoelectrical transduction - for example chemiosmosis within the key metabolic pathway of mitochondria: oxidative phosphorylation. An alternative way of implementing computational modularity using bond graphs is introduced and used to give a physically based model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain To illustrate the overall approach, this model is analyzed using the Faraday-equivalent chemical potential approach and engineering intuition is used to guide affinity equalisation: a energy based analysis of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.},

	abstract = {Bond graphs provide an energy-based methodology for modelling complex systems in a hierarchical fashion; at the moment, the method allows biological system with both chemical and electrical subsystems to be modelled. Herein, the bond graph approach is extended to include chemomechanical transduction thus extending the range of biological systems to be modelled.
Actin filament polymerisation and force generation is used as an example of chemo-mechanical transduction and it is shown that the TF (transformer) bond graph component provides a practical, and conceptually simple, alternative to the Brownian ratchet approach of Peskin, Odell, Oster \& Mogilner. Furthermore it is shown that the bond graph approach leads to the same equation as the Brownian ratchet approach in the simplest case.
The approach is illustrated by showing that flexibility and non-normal incidence can be modelled by simply adding additional bond graph components and that compliance leads to non-convexity of the force-velocity curve.
Energy flows are fundamental to life; for this reason, the energy based approach is utilised to investigate the power transmission by the actin filament and its corresponding efficiency.
The bond graph model is fitted to experimental data by adjusting model physical parameters.},

	abstract = {Synthetic biology aims to engineer novel functionalities into biological systems. While the approach has to date been predominantly applied to single cells, a richer set of biological phenomena can be engineered by applying synthetic biology to cell populations. To rationally design cell populations, we require mathematical models that link between intracellular biochemistry and intercellular interactions. In this study, we develop a kinetic model of gene expression that is suitable for incorporation into agent-based models of cell populations. To be scalable to large cell populations, models of gene expression should be both computationally efficient and compliant with the laws of physics. We satisfy the first requirement by applying a model reduction scheme to translation, and the second requirement by formulating models using bond graphs. Our reduced model is significantly faster to simulate than the full model, and faithfully reproduces important behaviours of the full model. We couple separate models of gene expression to build models of the toggle switch and repressilator. With these models, we explore the effects of resource availability and cell-to-cell heterogeneity on circuit behaviour. The modelling approaches developed in this study are a bridge towards engineering collective cell behaviours such as synchronisation and division of labour.},

	abstract = {The bond graph approach has been recognised as a useful conceptual basis for understanding the behaviour of living entities modelled as a system with hierarchical interacting parts exchanging energy. One such behaviour is oscillation, which underpins many essential biological functions. In this paper, energy-based modelling of biochemical systems using the bond graph approach is combined with classical feedback control theory to give a novel approach to the analysis, and potentially synthesis, of biochemical oscillators. It is shown that oscillation is dependent on the interplay between active and passive feedback and this interplay is formalised using classical frequency-response analysis of feedback systems. In particular, the phase margin is suggested as a simple scalar indicator of the presence or absence of oscillations; it is shown how this indicator can be used to investigate the effect of both the structure and parameters of biochemical system on oscillation. It follows that the combination of classical feedback control theory and the bond graph approach to systems biology gives a novel analysis and design methodology for biochemical oscillators.
The approach is illustrated using an introductory example similar to the Goodwin oscillator, the Sel’kov model of Glycolytic Oscillations and the Repressilator.},

	abstract = {Closed-loop control systems are designed for linear time-invariant (LTI) controllable and observable systems modelled by bond graph (BG). Cascade and feedback interconnections of BG models are realised through active bonds with no loading effect. The use of active bonds may lead to non-conservation of energy and the overall system is modelled by proposed pseudo-junction structures. These structures are build by adding parasitic elements to the BG models and the overall system may become singularly perturbed. The structures for these interconnections can be seen as consisting of inner structures that satisfy energy conservation properties and outer structures including multiport-coupled dissipative fields. These fields highlight energy properties like passivity that are useful for control design. In both interconnections, junction structures and dissipative fields for the controllers are proposed, and passivity is guaranteed for the closed-loop systems assuring robust stability. The cascade interconnection is applied to the structural representation of closed-loop transfer functions, when a stabilising controller is applied to a given nominal plant. Applications are given when the plant and the controller are described by state-space realisations. The feedback interconnection is used getting necessary and sufficient stability conditions based on the closed-loop characteristic polynomial, solving a pole-placement problem and achieving zero-stationary state error.},

The complexity of such models can present a number of obstacles for their practical use, often making problems difficult to intuit or computationally intractable. Methods of model reduction can be employed to alleviate the issue of complexity by seeking to eliminate those portions of a reaction network that have little or no effect upon the outcomes of interest, hence yielding simplified systems that retain an accurate predictive capacity. This review paper seeks to provide a brief overview of a range of such methods and their application in the context of biochemical reaction network models. To achieve this, we provide a brief mathematical account of the main methods including timescale exploitation approaches, reduction via sensitivity analysis, optimisation methods, lumping, and singular value decomposition-based approaches. Methods are reviewed in the context of large-scale systems biology type models, and future areas of research are briefly discussed.},

As an example, the analysis is applied to a behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid. By using bond graphs to model power flow through components within different physical domains of the hearing aid, a set of differential equations to describe the system dynamics is collated. Based on these equations, sensitivity analysis calculations are used to approximately model the nature and the sources of output uncertainty during system operation.
