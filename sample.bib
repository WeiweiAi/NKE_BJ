The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of Läuger and Apell, Eur.

As ions are transported, they become transiently trapped between intracellular and extracellular gates. Once the external gate opens, three Na+ ions are released, followed by the binding and occlusion of two K+ ions. While the mechanisms of Na+ release have been well characterized by the study of transient Na+ currents, smaller and faster transient currents mediated by external K+ have been more difficult to study. Here we show that external K+ ions travelling to their binding sites sense only a small fraction of the electric field as they rapidly and simultaneously become occluded. Consistent with these results, molecular dynamics simulations of a pump model show a wide water-filled access channel connecting the binding site to the external solution. These results suggest a mechanism of K+ gating different from that of Na+ occlusion.},

It may be thought of as having three substrates (ATP, intracellular Na+ ions, and extracellular K+ ions) and four products (ADP, orthophosphate, extracellular Na+ ions, and intracellular K+ ions.) Because more Na+ ions are pumped out than K+ ions are pumped in, the activity of the enzyme generates an outward movement of positive charge, and this outward current may also be considered a “product” of the reaction.},

In preparations of broken membranes it appears as an adenosine triphosphatase dependent on magnesium, sodium, and potassium ions together. In this adenosine triphosphatase a phosphorylated intermediate is formed from adenosine triphosphate in the presence of sodium ions and is hydrolyzed with the addition of potassium ions. The normal intermediate was not split by adenosine diphosphate. However, selective poisoning by N-ethylmaleimide or partial inhibition by a low magnesium ion concentration yielded an intermediate split by adenosine diphosphate and insensitive to potassium ions. Pulse experiments on the native enzyme supported further a hypothesis of a sequence of phosphorylated forms, the first being made reversibly from adenosine triphosphate in the presence of sodium ion and the second being made irreversiblyfrom the first and hydrolyzed in the presence of potassium ion. The cardioactive steriod inhibitor, ouabain, appeared to combine preferentially with the second form. Phosphorylation was at the same active site according to electrophoretic patterns of proteolytic phosphorylated fragments of both reactive forms. It is concluded that there is a conformational change in the active center for phosphorylation during the normal reaction sequence. This change may be linked to one required theoretically for active translocation of ions across the cell membrane.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract The cell membrane Na,K-ATPase is a member of the P-type family of active cation transport proteins. Recently the molecular structure of the related sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase in an E1 conformation has been determined at 2.6 Å resolution. Furthermore, theoretical models of the Ca-ATPase in E2 conformations are available. As a result of these developments, these structural data have allowed construction of homology models that address the central questions of mechanism of active cation transport by all P-type cation pumps. This review relates recent evidence on functional sites of Na,K-ATPase for the substrate (ATP), the essential cofactor (Mg2+ ions), and the transported cations (Na+ and K+) to the molecular structure. The essential elements of the Ca-ATPase structure, including 10 transmembrane helices and well-defined N, P, and A cytoplasmic domains, are common to all PII-type pumps such as Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPases. However, for Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, which consist of both α- and β-subunits, there may be some detailed differences in regions of subunit interactions. Mutagenesis, proteolytic cleavage, and transition metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavages are providing much evidence about residues involved in binding of Na+, K+, ATP, and Mg2+ ions and changes accompanying E1-E2 or E1-P-E2-P conformational transitions. We discuss this evidence in relation to N, P, and A cytoplasmic domain interactions, and long-range interactions between the active site and the Na+ and K+ sites in the transmembrane segments, for the different steps of the catalytic cycle.},

	abstract = {1. At high internal K concentrations the efflux of Na from red cells increases with internal Na concentration following an S-shaped curve. As internal K is reduced the S-shaped region and the value of internal Na for which the Na efflux is half-maximal are both shifted progressively towards zero., 2. The effects of internal Na on the shape of the Na efflux curves can be quantitatively accounted for if it is assumed that the rate of Na efflux is linearly related to the number of pump units having three identical and non-interacting sites occupied by Na., 3. The effects of internal K on the shape of the Na efflux curves are fully explained if it is assumed that the inner sites for Na of the Na pump also behave as identical and non-interacting sites for internal K, being the K-carrier complexes unable to promote Na translocation. The apparent affinity of the Na pump for internal K is about 50 times less than for internal Na., 4. Internal K not only alters the apparent affinity of the Na pump for Na, but also affects its turnover rate. The turnover rate of Na: K exchange increases with internal K following a curve which saturates at about 30 mM internal K. The turnover rate for Na:Na exchange increases linearly with internal K., 5. The linear dependence of the rate of Na:Na exchange on internal K explains why, when internal Na is increased at the expense of internal K, the rate of Na:Na exchange progressively decreases after passing through a maximum., 6. The effects of external Na on the rate of Na:Na exchange can be satisfactorily explained assuming that they are due to the occupation by external Na of three identical and non-interacting sites on each pump unit. The apparent affinity of the Na pump for external Na is about 160 times less than the apparent affinity for internal Na., 7. Under all the experimental conditions tested, it was found that the relation between flux and cation concentration at one of the surfaces of the cell membrane is altered only by a constant factor by changes in the cation composition at the opposite surface of the cell membrane. This fact strongly suggests that there are no interactions between the inner and outer sites of the Na pump., 8. The effects of inner and outer cations on both the Na:K and the Na:Na exchanges catalysed by the Na pump suggest that cation fluxes are proportional to the number of pump units having its inner and outer sites simultaneously occupied by the relevant cations. It seems therefore that sequential models for ion transort do not provide an adequate description of the molecular mechanism of active transport in red cells.},

Most charge moves during transitions that release Na+ to the cell exterior. When pumps are constrained to bind and release only Na+, a membrane voltage-step redistributes pumps among conformations with zero, one, two or three bound Na+, thereby transiently generating current. By applying rapid voltage steps to squid giant axons, we previously identified three components in such transient currents, with distinct relaxation speeds: fast (which nearly parallels the voltage-jump time course), medium speed (τm=0.2–0.5 ms) and slow (τs=1–10 ms). Here we show that these three components are tightly correlated, both in their magnitudes and in the time courses of their changes. The correlations reveal the dynamics of the conformational rearrangements that release three Na+ to the exterior (or sequester them into their binding sites) one at a time, in an obligatorily sequential manner.},

An analysis of thermal movements of protein atoms in the crystal shows that the M3–M4E helix pair opens and closes the ion pathway leading to the extracellular medium, allowing K+ at site II to be substituted first. Taken together, these results indicate that site I K+ is the first cation to bind to the empty cation-binding sites after releasing three Na+., 
The Na+,K+-ATPase moves three Na+ ions out of the cell and transfers two K+ ions in the opposite direction. Here the authors use X-ray crystallography to look at the substitution of two bound K+ with those in the medium and show that it occurs sequentially through a narrow gate.},

This is not predicted by the classical Albers-Post scheme of the Na+,K+-ATPase mechanism, where extracellular Na+ should act as a competitive inhibitor of extracellular K+ binding, which is necessary for the stimulation of enzyme dephosphorylation and the pumping of K+ ions into the cytoplasm. The increase in Ip is consistent with Na+ binding to an extracellular allosteric site, independent of the ion transport sites, and an increase in turnover via an acceleration of the rate-determining release of K+ to the cytoplasm, E2(K+)2 → E1 + 2K+. At normal physiological concentrations of extracellular Na+ of 140 mM, it is to be expected that binding of Na+ to the allosteric site would be nearly saturated. Its purpose would seem to be simply to optimize the enzyme’s ion pumping rate under its normal physiological conditions. Based on published crystal structures, a possible location of the allosteric site is within a cleft between the α- and β-subunits of the enzyme.},

	abstract = {Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na+/K+-ATPase, NKA) is an ion pump that generates an electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing ATP. During each Post-Albers cycle, NKA exchanges three cytoplasmic sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions through alternating changes between the E1 and E2 states. Hitherto, several steps remained unknown during the complete working cycle of NKA. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of recombinant human NKA (hNKA) in three distinct states at 2.7–3.2 Å resolution, representing the E1·3Na and E1·3Na·ATP states with cytosolic gates open and the basic E2·[2K] state, respectively. This work provides the insights into the cytoplasmic Na+ entrance pathway and the mechanism of cytoplasmic gate closure coupled with ATP hydrolysis, filling crucial gaps in the structural elucidation of the Post-Albers cycle of NKA.},

	abstract = {The observed standard free energy change (ΔG0obs) for the hydrolysis of the terminal pyrophosphate bond of ATP has been experimentally determined under physiological conditions using an entirely new set of reactions. The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) for the combined reactions of acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) and phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) has been determined at 38°, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and varying free [Mg2+]. The Kobs of these combined reactions reflects the difference between ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA and the ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of ATP. Using Σ and square brackets to indicate total concentration, Kobs = [ΣADP][ΣPi]/[ΣATP] x [Acetyl-CoA]/[ΣAcetate][CoA] The observed value of this combined equilibrium constant varies with free [Mg2+], being 0.984 ± 0.009 when [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.218 ± 0.002 when free [Mg2+] = 10-3m. The ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA is virtually unaffected by the free [Mg2+] and has been previously determined to be -8.54 Cal per mole (-35.75 kJ per mole) under the same conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Therefore at pH 7.0, at ionic strength 0.25, at 38°, and taking the standard state of liquid water to have activity = unity ([H2O] = 1) the ΔG0obs for the reaction [see PDF for equation] can be calculated to be -8.53 Cal per mole (-35.69 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 0 and -7.60 Cal per mole (-31.80 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 10-3m. The corresponding values of Kobs for the ATP hydrolysis reaction are 9.86 x 105m ([Mg2+] = 0) and 2.19 x 105m ([Mg2+] = 10-3m). Equations have been developed for calculating from the experimental data the ΔG0obs of ATP hydrolysis at different free magnesium and hydrogen ion concentrations. The Kobs of ATP hydrolysis has been used in combination with the Kobs of the citrate synthase reaction (EC 4.1.3.7) to calculate the Kobs of the ATP-citrate lyase reaction (EC 4.1.3.8) Kobs = [ΣADP][Acetyl-CoA] [ΣPi] [ΣOxaloacetate]/[ΣATP] [CoA] [ΣCitrate] Under the same near physiological conditions of 38°, pH 7.0, and ionic strength 0.25, the value of Kobs for the ATP-citrate lyase reaction was found to be very sensitive to the free [Mg2+], being 0.975 m at [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.0985 m when free [Mg2+] = 10-3m.},

By examining the pH-dependence of the hydrolysis Gibbs free energy, we show that in fact, above pH 7, ATP hydrolysis is spontaneous due mainly to the low concentration of the H+ that is released as product. Hence, ATP is essentially just an electrophilic target whose attack by H2O causes the acidity of the water nucleophile to increase dramatically; the spontaneity of the resulting acid ionization supplies much of the released Gibbs free energy. We also find that fermentation lowers pH not due to its organic acid products (e.g., lactic, acetic, formic, or succinic acids), but again, due to the H+ product of ATP hydrolysis.},

	abstract = {Ischemia-induced hyperkalemia (accumulation of extracellular K+) predisposes the heart to the development of lethal reentrant ventricular arrhythmias. This phenomenon exhibits a triphasic time course and is thought to be mediated by a combination of three mechanisms: 1) increased cellular K+ efflux, 2) decreased cellular K+ influx, and 3) shrinkage of the extracellular space. These ischemia-induced electrophysiological changes are driven by an impaired cellular metabolism. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms, as well as the origin of the triphasic profile, have proven to be difficult to determine experimentally. In this study, the changes in metabolite concentrations that arise during 15 min of zero-flow global ischemia were incorporated into a dynamic model of cellular electrophysiology, which was extended to include a metabolically sensitive description of the Na+-K+ pump and ATP-sensitive K+ channel, in addition to cell volume regulation. The coupling of altered K+ fluxes and cell volume regulation enables an integrative simulation of ischemic hyperkalemia. These simulations were able to quantitatively reproduce experimental measurements of the accumulation of extracellular K+ during 15 min of simulated ischemia, both with respect to the degree of K+ loss as well as the triphasic time course. Analysis of the model indicates that the inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump is the dominant factor underlying this hyperkalemic behavior, accounting for ∼85\% of the observed extracellular K+ accumulation. It was found that the balance between activation and inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump, affected by the changing metabolite and ion concentrations (in particular, [ADP]), give rise to the triphasic profile associated with ischemic hyperkalemia.},

Based on information gained on the kinetics of the enzyme's partial reactions we consider via computer simulation whether modifications to the function of the combined Na+,K+-ATPase/plasma membrane complex system could lead to an increased body temperature, either through the course of evolution or during an individual's lifespan. The enzyme's kinetics must be considered because it is the rate of heat generation which determines body temperature, not simply the amount of heat per enzymatic cycle. The results obtained indicate that a decrease in thermodynamic efficiency of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which could come about by Na+ substituting for K+ on the enzyme's extracellular face, could not account for increased thermogenesis. The only feasible mechanisms are an increase in the enzyme's expression level or an increase in its ion pumping activity. The major source of Na+,K+-ATPase-related thermogenesis (72\% of heat production) is found to derive from passive Na+ diffusion into the cell, which counterbalances outward Na+ pumping to maintain a constant Na+ concentration gradient across the membrane. A simultaneous increase in both Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the membrane's passive Na+ permeability could promote a higher body temperature.},

	abstract = {The Na+/K+-ATPase is an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein of all animal cells that couples the exchange of intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+ to the hydrolysis of ATP. The asymmetric distribution of Na+ and K+ is essential for cellular life and constitutes the physical basis of a series of fundamental biological phenomena. The pumping mechanism is explained by the Albers–Post model. It involves the presence of gates alternatively exposing Na+/K+-ATPase transport sites to the intracellular and extracellular sides and includes occluded states in which both gates are simultaneously closed. Unlike for K+, information is lacking about Na+-occluded intermediates, as occluded Na+ was only detected in states incapable of performing a catalytic cycle, including two Na+-containing crystallographic structures. The current knowledge is that intracellular Na+ must bind to the transport sites and become occluded upon phosphorylation by ATP to be transported to the extracellular medium. Here, taking advantage of epigallocatechin-3-gallate to instantaneously stabilize native Na+-occluded intermediates, we isolated species with tightly bound Na+ in an enzyme able to perform a catalytic cycle, consistent with a genuine occluded state. We found that Na+ becomes spontaneously occluded in the E1 dephosphorylated form of the Na+/K+-ATPase, exhibiting positive interactions between binding sites. In fact, the addition of ATP does not produce an increase in Na+ occlusion as it would have been expected; on the contrary, occluded Na+ transiently decreases, whereas ATP lasts. These results reveal new properties of E1 intermediates of the Albers–Post model for explaining the Na+ transport pathway.},

This research, carried out mostly on cardiac myocytes, shows that in addition to pumping ions, Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with neighboring membrane proteins and organized cytosolic cascades of signaling proteins to send messages to the intracellular organelles. The signaling pathways that are rapidly elicited by the interaction of ouabain with Na+/K+-ATPase, and are independent of changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations, include activation of Src kinase, transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by Src, activation of Ras and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria. In cardiac myocytes, the resulting downstream events include the induction of some early response proto-oncogenes, activation of the transcription factors, activator protein-1 and nuclear factor kappa-B, regulation of a number of cardiac growth-related genes, and stimulation of protein synthesis and myocyte hypertrophy. For these downstream events, the induced reactive oxygen species and rise in intracellular Ca2+ are essential second messengers. In cells other than cardiac myocytes, the proximal pathways linked to Na+/K+-ATPase through protein–protein interactions are similar to those reported in myocytes, but the downstream events and consequences may be significantly different. The likely extracellular physiological stimuli for the signal transducing function of Na+/K+-ATPase are the endogenous ouabain-like hormones, and changes in extracellular K+ concentration.},

	abstract = {The heart beats approximately 100,000 times per day in humans, imposing substantial energetic demands on cardiac muscle. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential energy source for normal function of cardiac muscle during each beat, as it powers ion transport, intracellular Ca2+ handling, and actin–myosin cross-bridge cycling. Despite this, the impact of excitation–contraction coupling on the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]i) in myocytes is poorly understood. Here, we conducted real-time measurements of [ATP]i in ventricular myocytes using a genetically encoded ATP fluorescent reporter. Our data reveal rapid beat-to-beat variations in [ATP]i. Notably, diastolic [ATP]i was {\textless}1 mM, which is eightfold to 10-fold lower than previously estimated. Accordingly, ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels were active at physiological [ATP]i. Cells exhibited two distinct types of ATP fluctuations during an action potential: net increases (Mode 1) or decreases (Mode 2) in [ATP]i. Mode 1 [ATP]i increases necessitated Ca2+ entry and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and were associated with increases in mitochondrial Ca2+. By contrast, decreases in mitochondrial Ca2+ accompanied Mode 2 [ATP]i decreases. Down-regulation of the protein mitofusin 2 reduced the magnitude of [ATP]i fluctuations, indicating that SR-mitochondrial coupling plays a crucial role in the dynamic control of ATP levels. Activation of β-adrenergic receptors decreased [ATP]i, underscoring the energetic impact of this signaling pathway. Finally, our work suggests that cross-bridge cycling is the largest consumer of ATP in a ventricular myocyte during an action potential. These findings provide insights into the energetic demands of EC coupling and highlight the dynamic nature of ATP concentrations in cardiac muscle.},

	abstract = {The Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) is an ubiquitous enzyme consisting of α, β and γ subunits, and is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Na+ and K+ gradients across the cell membrane by transporting 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ into the cell. Sodium pump regulation is tissue as well as isoform specific. Intracellular messengers differentially regulate the activity of the individual NKA isozymes. Regulation of specific NKA isozymes gives cells the ability to precisely coordinate NKA activity to their physiological requirements. It is the only known receptor for the cardiac glycosides used to treat congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Endogenous ligands structurally similar to cardiac glycosides may act as natural regulators of the sodium pump in heart and other tissues. Identification of naturally occurring regulators of  NKA could initiate the discovery of new hormone-like control systems involved in the etiology of selected disease processes, hence the importance of understanding the relation of the sodium pump and its ligands to disease. Diabetes has a marked effect on the metabolism of a variety of tissues and because the NKA is critical for the membrane potential and many transports, a change in its activity in diabetes would have profound consequence in these tissues. NKA is also involved in hypertension, salt balance, cardiovascular and renal disorders, sperm capacitation, cell volume regulation, apoptosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, neurological disorders, lung edema clearance and preeclampsia. NKA activity and expression in the collecting duct of kidney are modulated physiologically by hormones like aldosterone, vasopressin, and insulin. NKA enzyme activity and subunit levels are reduced in carcinoma, NKA-β levels were highly reduced in an invasive form of human renal clear cell carcinoma, androgen-dependent prostate cancer, in early stages of urothelial cancer, as well as in poorly differentiated, highly motile carcinoma cell lines obtained from various tissues suggesting a functional link between reduced NKA-β expression and cancer progression. It could be a target for the development of anticancer drugs as it serves as a signal transducer, it is a player in cell adhesion and its aberrant expression and activity are implicated in the development and progression of different cancers.},

	abstract = {Like several other ion transporters, the Na+-K+ pump of animal cells is electrogenic. The pump generates the pump current I p. Under physiological conditions, I p is an outward current. It can be measured by electrophysiological methods. These methods permit the study of characteristics of the Na+-K+ pump in its physiological environment, i.e., in the cell membrane. The cell membrane, across which a potential gradient exists, separates the cytosol and extracellular medium, which have distinctly different ionic compositions. The introduction of the patch-clamp techniques and the enzymatic isolation of cells have facilitated the investigation of I p in single cardiac myocytes. This review summarizes and discusses the results obtained from I p measurements in isolated cardiac cells. These results offer new exciting insights into the voltage and ionic dependence of the Na+-K+ pump activity, its effect on membrane potential, and its modulation by hormones, transmitters, and drugs. They are fundamental for our current understanding of Na+-K+ pumping in electrically excitable cells.},
