\section*{Introduction}

The \gls{nka} uses the hydrolysis of ATP to move Na\textsuperscript{+} ions out of the cell and K\textsuperscript{+} ions into the cell,
in both cases against steep concentration gradients. ATP hydrolysis can be thought of as the energy source that tops up the cell's `sodium' battery,
since the the majority of transmembrane transport processes are driven by this sodium gradient.
The NKA pump is therefore critical to cellular function in all cell types.

In this paper we use a bond graph approach to examine a number of models of NKA in which mass, charge and energy are each conserved.
We examine a previously published 15-state bond graph model,
and then show how a much simpler 6-state model captures the biophysics of the pump, matches experimental data.
We then show how the bond graph facilitates analysis to examine the energy expenditure of the \Gls{nka} and energy storage and dissipation under different conditions.

\subsection*{\Gls{nka} physiology and models}

The \Gls{nka} was discovered in 1957\cite{skou_influence_1957},
and is a chemical molecular machine responsible for the movement of Na\textsuperscript{+} and K\textsuperscript{+} ions across the cell membrane against their concentration gradients.
The Albers–Post kinetic scheme \cite{albers_role_1963,post_activation_1972} was proposed to describe the transport mechanism of the \Gls{nka} \cite{apell_electrogenic_1989},
where the \Gls{nka} undergoes Na\textsuperscript{+}-dependent phosphorylation and K\textsuperscript{+}-dependent dephosphorylation reactions and alternates between two main conformations, 
\textit{E1} and \textit{E2}, which expose the transport sites to the intracellular and extracellular sides of the membrane, respectively.

Many intermediate conformational states and partial reaction steps have been proposed \cite{post_flexibility_1969,karlish_conformational_1978,glynn_na_1985, apell_electrogenic_1989,terkildsen_balance_2007},
while structural studies have provided insights into the molecular mechanism of the \Gls{nka}.
The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of \Gls{nka} in different conformational states were reported,
including exoplasmic side-open (\textit{E2\textperiodcentered P})\cite{kanai_binding_2021,nguyen_structural_2022},
K\textsuperscript{+}-occluded (\textit{E2\textperiodcentered [2K] \textperiodcentered Pi}) \cite{morth_crystal_2007,shinoda_crystal_2009,nguyen_structural_2022},
(\textit{E2\textperiodcentered [2K]})\cite{guo_cryo-em_2022},
cytoplasmic side-open (\textit{E1})\cite{nguyen_structural_2022}, ATP bound cytoplasmic side-open (\textit{E1\textperiodcentered ATP})\cite{nguyen_structural_2022},
(\textit{E1\textperiodcentered [3Na]\textperiodcentered ATP})\cite{guo_cryo-em_2022}.
Na\textsuperscript{+}-occluded (\textit{E1\textperiodcentered [3Na]\textperiodcentered P\text{-}ADP}) \cite{nyblom_crystal_2013,kanai_crystal_2013,nguyen_structural_2022},
and (\textit{E1\textperiodcentered [3Na]})\cite{guo_cryo-em_2022}.

Since the \Gls{nka} transports three Na\textsuperscript{+} ions outward and two K\textsuperscript{+} ions inward,
the process gives rise to a net outward current and is therefore electrogenic\cite{apell_electrogenic_1989,glitsch_electrophysiology_2001}.
That is, the \Gls{nka} contributes to the membrane potential and the transport rate is a function of the membrane potential.
The electrogenicity of the \Gls{nka} has been studied experimentally and the main voltage-dependent steps are associated with the binding and release of Na\textsuperscript{+} ions.
These include Na\textsuperscript{+}-mediated transient electrical currents \cite{nakao_voltage_1986} and Na\textsuperscript{+} efflux \cite{gadsby_extracellular_1993}.
More recently, the electrogenicity of extracellular K\textsuperscript{+} binding was also investigated \cite{peluffo_electrogenic_1997}
while K\textsuperscript{+} uptake was found to be less voltage-dependent \cite{moreno_transient_2020}.

Terkildsen et al. \cite{terkildsen_balance_2007} developed a kinetic model of the \Gls{nka} based on the Albers-Post scheme including fifteen intermediate states.
This model detailed the binding and release of Na\textsuperscript{+} and K\textsuperscript{+} ions and their voltage dependence.
It also explicitly included the proton to enable the study of the effect of pH on the pump function,
which was found to be significant in ischemic conditions.
The model was subsequently corrected by Pan et al. \cite{pan_cardiac_2020} to address inconsistencies in the original model using a bond graph approach to ensure thermodynamic consistency.
The \Gls{nka} consumes 19-28\% of the total ATP consumption in mammals, and up to 50-60\% in brain and kidney \cite{rolfe_cellular_1997}.
The experimental study in guinea-pig cardiac ventricular muscle showed that the \Gls{nka} is responsible for 9\% of myocardial heat production during contraction,
and 17\% at rest \cite{schramm1994energy}.
Hence, it is important to guarantee thermodynamic consistency in \Gls{nka} models, and the bond graph is also used in this study to facilitate energy-based analysis.

\subsection*{Bond graph modes of \Gls{nka} with 6 states}

We build a bond graph mode of \Gls{nka} with 6 states, in Figure \ref{fig:6state_v1}, based on the scheme in Fig. 1b of \cite{nguyen_structural_2022} with slight modifications.
We merged (\textit{E1\textperiodcentered [3Na]\textperiodcentered ATP}) and (\textit{E1\textperiodcentered [3Na]\textperiodcentered P\text{-}ADP}), 
while splitting the release of ADP AND Na\textsuperscript{+} into two steps.

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
      \item I had tried time course fitting (to save fitting time), the results are worse so I didn’t include them in the above figures.
      6-state\_v3\_ss\_free is not included as well due to the poor fitting.
      \item “ss” means that we fitted the steady state data, “\_free” means no constraints on the thermodynamical parameters of the NKE states.
      \item In general, ss with the constraints fit the data better than the “free” ones.
      \item The constraints mainly affect the figures with potential $V_m$ and $K_e$.
      \item The voltage dependency (v1 vs v2) does not seem to affect the steady state. I will analyze their effect on the dynamics later.
      \item The separation of  unbind of Na and ADP steps (v1 and v2 separated them while  v3 combined them) seems to be critical.
      \item Another round of fitting with corrected constraints and broarder parameter bounds is ongoing.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Energy based analysis of models of \Gls{nka} and comparision}
The reduction of free energy available from ATP hydrolysis results in an accumulation of intracellular Na\textsuperscript{+} ions \cite{jansen2003energy},
while increase in intracellular Pi and decreases in intracellular pH and ATP were associated with ischemic conditions \cite{huang1984regulation}.

ATP concentration ranges from 1.92–7.47 mM with average of 4.4 mM \cite{greiner_intracellular_2021},
while the recent study showed lower diastolic cytosolic ATP levels (less than 1 mM) than previously estimated and fluctuations during excitation-contraction coupling \cite{rhana_fueling_2024}.

TODO:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Thermodynamic efficiency of the pump under different conditions (vary ATP, ADP, Pi, pH, Na, K, V)
      \item Compare the efficiency of different models
      \item Compare the dynamics of different models
      \item Compare the heat production of different models
\end{itemize}
